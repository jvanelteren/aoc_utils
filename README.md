Have fun with this package

## Install

Haven't uploaded to pypi yet. For now run git clone and if you want to install locally
`pip install . -e aoc_utils` (when in root aoc_utils directory)

## How to use

Just do as follows:

```
from aoc_utils.aoc import *
aoc.to_int(['22222', 'aaaaa', 22222])
```




    [22222, 'aaaaa', 22222]
